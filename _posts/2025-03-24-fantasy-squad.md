title: "Optimizing a Fantasy Football Squad with OR-Tools and .NET"
categories: dotnet

## Introduction

While building my fantasy football site [xperty.se](https://xperty.se/), I wanted to add a tool that automatically picks the best possible team within a set of strict constraints. This post walks through how I implemented an optimizer using C# and Google's OR-Tools to create the optimal squad for fantasy football.

## 1. The Problem

Fantasy football isn't just about picking your favorite players. You‚Äôre limited by:

- A budget cap
- A fixed number of players per position
- A max of 3 players per real-life team

I wanted to automate the selection process to find the team with the highest expected points while staying within these limits.

## 2. The Tools

- **.NET (C#)**: For the core application logic
- **Google OR-Tools**: For solving the optimization problem

## 3. Modeling the Squad Selection as an Optimization Problem

We treat this as a **Mixed Integer Linear Programming** problem. Each player is represented by a boolean variable ‚Äì either they're in the squad or not.

### üéØ Objective Function: Maximize Expected Points
```csharp
objective.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], player.ExpectedPoints);
objective.SetMaximization();
```

### üí∞ Constraint: Stay Under Budget
```csharp
Constraint budgetConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(0, (double)budget);
budgetConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], (double)player.Cost);
```

### üìå Position Constraints
```csharp
Constraint midfieldersConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(5, 5);
midfieldersConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
```

### üõë Max 3 Players Per Team
```csharp
Constraint teamConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(0, 3);
teamConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
```

## 4. The Code

Here‚Äôs a more detailed version of the core logic:

```csharp
public static class SquadSelector
{
    // Define the team constraints
    private const int MaxPlayersPerTeam = 3;
    private const int NumGoalkeepers = 2;
    private const int NumDefenders = 5;
    private const int NumMidfielders = 5;
    private const int NumForwards = 3;

    public static FantasySquad OptimizeTeam(List<SquadPlayer> players)
    {
        var budget = 100M;

        var selectedPlayers = new List<SquadPlayer>();

        // Create the solver
        var solver = Solver.CreateSolver("SCIP");

        // Define the decision variables
        Dictionary<string, Variable> playerVars = [];

        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            playerVars[player.Name] = solver.MakeBoolVar(player.Name);
        }

        // Define the objective function
        var objective = solver.Objective();
        objective.SetMaximization();

        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            objective.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], player.ExpectedPoints);
        }

        // Add the budget constraint
        Constraint budgetConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(0, (double)budget);

        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            budgetConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], (double)player.Cost);
        }

        // Add the position constraints
        Constraint goalkeepersConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(NumGoalkeepers, NumGoalkeepers);
        Constraint defendersConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(NumDefenders, NumDefenders);
        Constraint midfieldersConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(NumMidfielders, NumMidfielders);
        Constraint forwardsConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(NumForwards, NumForwards);

        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            if (player.PlayerType == 1)
            {
                goalkeepersConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
            }
            else if (player.PlayerType == 2)
            {
                defendersConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
            }
            else if (player.PlayerType == 3)
            {
                midfieldersConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
            }
            else if (player.PlayerType == 4)
            {
                forwardsConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
            }
        }

        // Add the constraint for maximum players per team
        var teams = players.Select(p => p.TeamId).Distinct();

        foreach (var team in teams)
        {
            Constraint teamConstraint = solver.MakeConstraint(0, MaxPlayersPerTeam, $"MaxPlayersPerTeam_{team}");

            foreach (var player in players.Where(p => p.TeamId == team))
            {
                teamConstraint.SetCoefficient(playerVars[player.Name], 1);
            }
        }

        // Solve the problem
        Solver.ResultStatus resultStatus = solver.Solve();

        // Get the selected players
        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            if (playerVars[player.Name].SolutionValue() > 0.5)
            {
                selectedPlayers.Add(player);
            }
        }

        // Release resources
        solver.Dispose();

        ...
}
```

## 5. Real-World Application on Xperty

This logic is now live and powers the **auto-pick** functionality on [xperty.se](https://www.xperty.se/). Users can click one button and get the best possible team based on latest projections ‚Äì no manual tweaking required.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Google OR-Tools is a powerful solver even in .NET environments.
- Modeling the problem correctly is more important than complex code.
- Optimization tools can bring real value to data-driven applications.

## 7. What‚Äôs Next?

I‚Äôm exploring dynamic constraints for future features:
- Selecting captains automatically
- Including/excluding specific players
- Adjusting based on upcoming fixtures
